Content posting platform based on microservices

The project eventually got discontinued - it served primarily as a learning experience.

The key elements of this project are:
- microservices
- hexagonal architecture
- high retention with caching and database replication
- gateway with redirects, graphql stitching, api throttling, header propagation, auth propagation etc.


**unit test and integration test coverage not included, I kept it in different project and it went 'poof'**
